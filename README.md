# Integrating the Cisco Meraki Scanning API, with Meraki MV, Cisco Spark, Google Maps and Node-RED

Document URL: Coming Soon

## Summary

This repository contains a range of Node-RED node code snippets to aid in building a Raspberry Pi device, running Node-RED, to integrate with the Cisco Meraki Scanning API, Cisco Meraki MV, Cisco Spark API and Google Static Maps API. 


## Description

The purpose of this document/project is to assist users in building a working minimum viable product (MVP), by provisioning a Raspberry Pi device for use with the Cisco Meraki Scanning API and Node-RED. It furthers extends this goal by integrating with Cisco Meraki MV, Cisco Spark and Google Maps APIs to provide a fun and useful website that allows one to visually track wireless and Bluetooth devices within your Meraki network. 


### Installing

The source code included in this repository is designed to be paired with the "Integrating the Cisco Meraki Scanning API, with Meraki MV, Cisco Spark, Google Maps and Node-RED" whitepaper hosted on the [Cisco Meraki Create Space](https://create.meraki.io/)

It aims to deliver step-by-step instructions to educate and guide the reader from start to finish. It is hoped and encouraged that you can use this document as a guide to start your own API learning journey.
