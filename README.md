 *--- TITLE ---*

 Integrating the Cisco Meraki Scanning API, with Meraki MV, Cisco Spark, Google Maps and Node-RED
 URL: Coming Soon

 *--- SUMMARY ---*

 This repository contains a range of Node-RED node code snippets to aid in building a Raspberry Pi device, running Node-RED, to integrate with the Cisco Meraki Scanning API, Cisco Meraki MV, Cisco Spark API and Google Static Maps API.  

 The primary purpose of this project is education. 

 *--- DESCRIPTION ---*
 The purpose of this document is to assist users in building a working minimum viable product (MVP), by provisioning a Raspberry Pi device for use with the Cisco Meraki Scanning API and Node-RED. It furthers extends this goal by integrating with Cisco Meraki MV, Cisco Spark and Google Maps APIs to provide a fun and useful website that allows one to visually track wireless and Bluetooth devices within your Meraki network. 

 The source code included in this repository is designed to be paired with the "Integrating the Cisco Meraki Scanning API, with Meraki MV, Cisco Spark, Google Maps and Node-RED" whitepaper hosted on the Cisco Meraki Create Space: https://create.meraki.io/
 (To be published soon)

 It aims to deliver step-by-step instructions to  educate and guide the reader from start to finish. It is hoped and encouraged that you can use this document as a guide to start your own API learning journey.
